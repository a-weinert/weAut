<h3><a name="be">Description</a></h3>
This package de.frame4j.time contains the core helper classes for
time (time and date) handling.<br />
<br />
Providing a robust, comfortable and real time usable base for Java 
applications of all kinds is the premier design goal. Another
one is avoiding throw-away objects and multiple evaluations, for performance
sake. Therefore something looks like a substitute for standard Java-classes 
&mdash; at first sight.<br />
<br />
Considering time most of this substitution needs were gone with Java 8, the 
first version to provide something reasonable in this field. This package
handles (with high-performance) all time keeping aspects not ported from 
Frame4J to Java8 &mdash; the ported ones were removed from Frame4J .<br />
