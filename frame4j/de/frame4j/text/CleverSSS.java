/** <b>Subsequence search algorithms &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp; the base</b>. <br />
 *  <br /> 
 *  An object of this type represents a character sequence to be searched
 *  for in other and longer character sequences. This class features a big 
 *  variety of &quot;indexOf&quot; implementation variants. A 
 *  {@link CleverSSS} object holds<ul>
 *  <li> all immutable state </li>
 *  <li> plus some settings </li>
 *  <li> and methods </li>
 *  <li> implementing some search algorithms being clever in the sense of
 *      O(n) instead of the usual O(n*m).</li>
 *  </ul>
 *  The rationale behind clever &quot;indexOf&quot; algorithms like Rabin
 *  Karp ({@link RK RK}, Knuth Morris Pratt ({@link KMP}) and others is their 
 *  very successful striving for O(n). The standard (&quot;naive&quot;
 *  loop-in-loop) algorithms, also used in {@link String} and consorts, are 
 *  of type O(n*m).<br />
 *  <br />
 *  This class and its extensions (like {@link RK} and {@link KMP}) hide their
 *  constructors behind factory respectively make() methods. Inheritors do
 *  neither have to handle the cases, where an 
 *  &quot;{@link #optimisticOK optimistic}&quot; search is 
 *  sufficient nor do they have to handle the the trivial cases of<ul>
 *   <li>subsequences to search for that are null, empty or shorter than
 *       two characters either from start,</li>
 *   <li>or after removing white space to be 
 *       {@link #ignoreWS ignored} optionally.</li></ul>
 *       
 *  This class handles those trivial optimistic, length one and empty cases.
 *  The latter are handled according to {@link String java.lang.String}:
 *  {@link String String} regards an empty subsequence as occurring everywhere
 *  or being every other {@link String}'s prefix. But the implementing classes
 *  factories must recognise those special cases and indirectly call this
 *  classes factories or constructors accordingly.<br />  
 *  <br />
 *  {@link CleverSSS} objects made or returned by the factories are immutable.
 *  The rationale behind making objects of this type immutable is their
 *  multiple and threadsafe re-usability. Inheritors must be immutable too
 *  and should preferably be final.<br />
 *  <br />
 *  As a {@link CharSequence} a {@link CleverSSS} object, besides providing
 *  the search algorithms, <b>is</b> at the same time (as of type
 *  {@link CharSequence}) the sub sequence to search for. In case of 
 *  {@link #ignoreCase} being true this {@link CharSequence sequence} is all
 *  lower case. In case of {@link #ignoreWS} it does not contain any blanks at
 *  all and may hence be significantly shorter than the {@link CharSequence}
 *  supplied to the factory method as the original search sequence.<br />
 *  <br />
 *  Motivation to use more clever substring searches (CleverSSS):<br />
 *  Subsequence searches of the {@link #indexOf(CharSequence, int) indexOf()}
 *  type are where heavy duty text processing tools &mdash; like 
 *  {@link de.frame4j.SVNkeys SVNkeys} or {@link de.frame4j.FuR FuR} &mdash;
 *  do spend most of their processing time [sic!]. For example, beautifying
 *  all SVN keys of all (some 200) Frame4J's source files by 
 *  {@link de.frame4j.SVNkeys SVNkeys}  once took over 15 seconds. Shifting to
 *  {@link RK} and then to {@link KMP} took this down to 600ms on the same
 *  machine. <br />
 *  It might well be put in those words: If a search for the same subsequence
 *  occurs more than twice in your application, using one of 
 *  {@link CleverSSS}'s inheritors is usually well worth the virtually nil
 *  extra effort.<br />
