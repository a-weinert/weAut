<h1>GithubPages Umlaut test</h1>
<h2>Symptoms</h2>
&Auml; Ä; &Ouml; Ö; &Uuml; Ü; <br />
&auml; Ä; &ouml; Ö; &uuml; Ü; &szlig; ß; <br />

Here &amp; Auml; is followed by the iso-8859-1 &Auml;; and so on. <br />
Every well behaving (Apache 2.4 without forcing encoding) web server 
delivers this page unspoiled but Github Pages won't.<br />
With GitHub Pages all iso-8859-1 characters above 127 get displayed as 
question mark in black diamond (&#xfffd;).<br />

<h2>Background</h2>
Our very first (quasi hello world) experience with GitHub Pages was disappointing:
Almost all well tested pages transferred (pushed) there were miss-rendered by 
several browsers. This page was started as  test page to explore the failure's
reason.<br />
<br />
In spite of <br />
&nbsp; &lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="iso-8859-1"?&gt; <br />
and <br />
&nbsp; &lt;meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=iso-8859-1" /&gt; <br />
as well as even (irrelevant for character set settings, of course)<br /> 
&nbsp; &lt;meta http-equiv="content-language" content="de" /&gt; <br />
all German Umlauts are spoiled.<br />
<br />
See this very page on Apache 2.4: <br />

<h2>Diagnosis</h2>
The failure has two reasons:<ol>
<li> GitHub Pages says encoding UTF8 in its response header &mdash; at least
  in our case. Searches, so far, found no documentation therefore. And all
  introductory examples &mdash; three steps to your first web page on 
  GitHub &mdash; don't give a warning.</li>
<li> There seems to be a rule that the response header's encoding indication
  overrules all header and xml attribute setting in a web page. And all 
  browsers seem to obey this rule.<br />
  Considering a perfectly consistent static web page encoded in iso-8859-11
  and saying so, this behaviour respectively preference rule seems a totally
  senseless recipe for false rendering.</li>
</ol>
Tip: No web server should use encoding in its response header when (as usual)
unaware of the content.
