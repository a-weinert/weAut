<h1>GithubPages Umlaut test</h1>
<h2>Symptoms</h2>
&Auml; Ä; &Ouml; Ö; &Uuml; Ü; <br />
&auml; Ä; &ouml; Ö; &uuml; Ü; &szlig; ß; <br />

Here &amp; Auml; is followed by the iso-8859-1 &Auml;; and so on. <br />
Every well behaving web server (Apache 2.4 without forcing encoding)  
delivers this page unspoiled but Github Pages won't.<br />
With GitHub Pages all iso-8859-1 characters above 127 get displayed as 
question mark in black diamond (&#xfffd;).<br />

<h2>Background</h2>
Our very first (quasi hello world) experience using pages generated by our 
development / deployment environment at GitHub Pages was disappointing:
Almost all well tested pages transferred (pushed) there were miss-rendered by 
several browsers. This page was started as minimal test page to explore the
failure's reason.<br />
<br />
In spite of <br />
&nbsp; &lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="iso-8859-1"?&gt; <br />
and <br />
&nbsp; &lt;meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=iso-8859-1" /&gt; <br />
as well as even (irrelevant for character set settings, of course)<br /> 
&nbsp; &lt;meta http-equiv="content-language" content="de" /&gt; <br />
all German Umlauts French accents etc. are spoiled.<br />
<br />
See this very page on Apache 2.4: <br />
 &nbsp; <a href="https://weinert-automation.de/infos/umlautGitHubPages.html"
   title="Umlauts not spoiled on Apache2.4">weinert-automation.de/infos/umlautGitHubPages.html</a><br />
And see it on GitHub Pages: <br />
 &nbsp; <a href="https://a-weinert.github.io/weAut/umlautGitHubPages.html"
   title="All Umlauts spoiled on GitHub Pages with any encoding but UTF-8"
   >a-weinert.github.io/weAut/umlautGitHubPages.html</a><br /> 
   
<h2>Diagnosis</h2>
The failure has two reasons:<ol>
<li> GitHub Pages says encoding UTF8 in its response header &mdash; at least
  in our case. Searches, so far, found no documentation therefore (except
  Jekyll naming UTF-8 as default). And all introductory examples &mdash; 
  three steps to your first web page on GitHub &mdash; don't give a 
  warning.</li>
<li> There seems to be a rule that the response header's encoding indication
  overrules all header and xml attribute setting in a web page. And all 
  browsers seem to obey this rule.<br />
  Considering a perfectly consistent static web page encoded in iso-8859-11
  and saying so, this behaviour respectively preference rule seems a totally
  senseless recipe for false rendering.</li>
</ol>
Tip: No web server should use encoding in its response header when (as usual)
unaware of the content.

<h2>No remedies</h2>
Best would be all browsers giving the explicit page encoding preference over
the server response. The latter should only the (server region) default, 
when the page encoding  was forgotten. But that cannot be changed. <br />
<br />
If working in Western Europe and doing almost everything in ISO-8859-1 or 
similar code pages you would like to avoid UTF8. Theoretically GitHub pages
should obey <br />
<code>encoding: ISO-8859-1</code><br />
in the _config.yml. But that doesn't yield the expected result. And, most 
probably Jekyll, Liquid and Co. would not work when turning off UTF-8 
&mdash; and they are gorgeous.<br />
Hence, when going GitHub Pages turn your development environment to UTF-8, 
even when living and working in France, Italy, Netherlands, Belgium ...
