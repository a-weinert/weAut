This  package {@link de.weAut} is the base Java process control with small

<br />
As of Revision 17, May 2019, we keep {@link de.weAut} in the same SVN
source repository as the framework Frame4J, packages {@link de.frame4j} and
below and deploy it in one frame4j.jar. This might be changed in the
future. And we rely on a Java 8 with still intact installed extension
mechanism.<br />
